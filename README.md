```

## Data

Describe the data used in the project. Include details on where to find the data, its format, and any preprocessing steps performed.

## Models

1. **Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**
Use the product images in the "images" directory.
Extract the product categories from the "masterCategory" column in the "styles.csv" file.
Build a CNN model to classify images into different master categories.
Train the model using the images and their corresponding master categories.


2. **NLP-based Classifier using Product Descriptions:**
Extract product descriptions from the "styles" directory, for example, from "styles/42431.json."
Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process and vectorize the product descriptions.
Train a classifier, such as a text classification model, to predict the masterCategory based on product descriptions.


3. **Multi-Label Classification:**
Extend your classification task to predict other category labels in addition to the masterCategory.
Modify your model to handle multi-label classification, where each product can belong to multiple categories.
Update your dataset and model accordingly.

## Evaluation

Explain how the project's performance is evaluated. Include metrics or criteria used to measure success.

## Contributing

Provide guidelines for others who want to contribute to the project. Include information on how to report issues, submit feature requests, or contribute code.

## License

Specify the project's license to clarify how others can use and contribute to it.

## Acknowledgments

Give credit to individuals or sources that contributed to the project, including libraries, datasets, or inspiration.

Feel free to customize this template based on the specific needs and characteristics of your data science project. The key is to provide clear and comprehensive information to help others understand, use, and contribute to the project.
